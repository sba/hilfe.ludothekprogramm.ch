# Algolia Pro Plugin

The **Algolia Pro** Plugin is an extension for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). A **valid Algolia Pro License** is required to install and use this plugin.  Please check out the [Algolia Pro Premium page](https://getgrav.org/premium/algolia-pro) for full details.

## Installation

Installing the Algolia Pro plugin can be done in one of three ways: The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method lets you quickly install the plugin with a simple terminal command, the manual method lets you do so via a zip file, and the admin method lets you do so via the Admin Plugin.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

To install the plugin via the [GPM](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm), through your system's terminal (also called the command line), navigate to the root of your Grav-installation, and enter:

    bin/gpm install algolia-pro

This will install the Algolia Pro plugin into your `/user/plugins`-directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/algolia-pro`.

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `algolia-pro`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-algolia-pro) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/algolia-pro
	
> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which may require other plugins to operate, please see its [blueprints.yaml-file on GitHub](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-algolia-pro/blob/master/blueprints.yaml).
